							However, modern imageboards have expanded to allow users to create their own boards.
							Exposing them to an unpolished, glitchy, complicated, and featureless backend is frustrating for everyone.
							As a final ambition for the $1,600 stretch goal, the framework for a proper board configuration will be laid.

							Staff running a large imageboard often have to deal with illegal or copyrighted content.
							The systems in place to automatically root out this stuff on YouTube or other large systems is widely unavailable to smaller websites.
							At this mark, in preparation of moving large imageboards onto Infinity, I can begin to deal with <em>attachment bans</em>.
							<br /><br />
							This handles two tasks.
							First, allowing media of any format to be banned based on its hash.
							The second more complicated task is "fuzzy hashing", or banning images based on what they look like.
							A small, single-pixel change to a banned image (like child pornography) will completely change its hash.
							However, by utilizing special algorithms, it's possible to accurately ban this content based on what it looks like without having to store any illegal content on the server.

							<em>AdBlock</em> is an extremely popular advertisement blocking software that utilizes a shared database to propagate bans to everyone using the plugin.
							Similarly, I can take time to set up Infinity to have databases of illegal hashes and known spam methods.
							Any instance of Infinity that <strong>opts in</strong> to use this database would learn bad hashes before ever seeing it itself.
							We can apply this to spam as well, and strengthen the security of all websites using the technology.

							The financial system is a bit of a monopoly, and this unfairness was what led me to build my own fundraising tools.

					However, I have a pipe dream.
					<br /><br />
					With enough time and money, I would build what I've taken to calling a <em>confederation</em>.
					Rather than a single large website with many boards, a confederaton could run with many nodes, each with only a few boards.
					Other nodes could propagate the content of that board to their own database, and push posts made to the source (if allowed).
					Confederate nodes could centralize these independantly operated boards and act as an access point, while not revealing the true source of each node.
					<br /><br />
					Using this setup, information pushed into the confederation could not die.
					Malicious entities or governments who attempted to destroy one node would not cost the network any information.
					It would continue to propagate forward to as many individual nodes as possible.
					<br /><br />
					Just a pipe dream.

			<h3 class="me-title">My life in a few sentences</h3>
			<p>I'm Josh. I am neither a profiteer, nor a businessman.</p>
			<p>I made my first website at nine, hosted it on Geocities and wrote about my cat. Only a few years later, I picked up a video game with pretty extensive modability and began writing my own stuff for it. People liked what I made, and development of my mods consumed my free time when I was in middle school and high school. I didn't care about worksheets, only my code. Every day I'd bring home binders of college-ruled paper filled with nothing but pseudocode and ideas.</p>
			<p>The gamemode became pretty popular. When I was about fifteen, the older developers started talking about using MySQL as a storage engine for game data instead of plaintext files. I didn't know how to set up MySQL on my computer at that time, but I did know it was installed on my Dreamhost website, so I wrote a module that stored all this information online. Eventually I realized I could pull this data and make a high-score table, and I did. This was about all I got done before growing too old to stay interested in the game, however, and ended up transforming what I had made into an EVE Online fansite that read information from the EVE API system.</p>
			<p>By the time I was 17 I had dropped out of highschool and college. Neither could hold my attention, so I didn't do well. I focused all my time into learning more about web development and put all my chips on the table. I knew if I was going to do anything in life, I'd be working online. When one of my corpmates saw my EVE Online website, they liked it, and offered me work. Later that year we were both employed full time by a start-up with 3 developers (inclusive) and 6 staff total.</p>
			<p>Two years later, the company handled over $4,000,000,000 in payroll that annuam. It was no longer a start-up and they could afford to pay me enough to move out of my friend's place. Over the course of my employment with them, I had moved seven times in just under four years, traveling well over 16,000 miles combined. But, as they continued to grow, the rigid structures closed in around me. I was no longer able to set my own times and was never allowed to participate in the creation of solutions. People hired into positions over me handed decisions from on high and that is what I had to code. The thrill of the job had evaporated.</p>
			<p>As a developer, I thrive off passion. Knowing what I build is used and enjoyed, knowing that people depend on me. When every client was "the most important" and big deals could make or break the entire company, sixty hour weeks and sixteen hour shifts were adventures, not labor. By the end of my run with the company, it had gone as far from that as possible. Everything was dull, and again I was bored.</p>
			<p>So, I left.</p>
			<p>I am poised to do anything I want. With four years of work experience, I meet the minimum requirements for most jobs in my industry without having a diploma. I could whip up a portfolio website and find a replacement job in no time. I've already gotten offers, but that's not what I want to do.<br />My goals are now elsewhere: passion projects. This is where Infinity (and you) fit in.</p>
